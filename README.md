Autonomous Cars Communication

Imagine a world where cars are autonomous and they need to talk with each other and share information about:

Car information (manufacturer, model, unique ID)
Current Speed
Current Location (in coordinates X and Y)
Encountered events in the last 100km
You will need to implement a class (or multiple if you see it fit) that will do at least the following tasks:

Receive information from other cars
Send information to another car
Set the current speed
Calculate distance to another car
Pick the closest car
